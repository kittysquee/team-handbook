Your account has become locked. Gandalf says you shall not pass.

To unlock your account whilst in the office do the following:

1. Go to a WYSE machine (@todo add link to WYSE machine instructions)
2. On the login screen click on forgotten password
3. Enter your Username (firstname.lastname)
4. You will then be asked to answer two questions that you were asked when setting up your login
5. When successful select the option to unlock account

You should now be able to return to your Mac and enter your password to gain access to your emails again

To unlock your account when away from the office, call IS on 020 8498 7777.
