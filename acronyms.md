# Acronyms, TLAs and Jargon

For any internal, design or development related jargon we have a little Slackbot called Glossbot who can help us find the definition when we forget. 

To use glossbot, use the following commands in any channel in Slack ü§ñ

- `/gloss term` to show the definition for a term
- `/gloss term = definition` to set the definition for a term
- `/gloss alias = see term` to set an alias for a term
- `/gloss delete term` to delete the definition for a term
- `/gloss stats` to show usage statistics
- `/gloss recent` to show recently defined terms
- `/gloss search term` to search terms and definitions
- `/gloss shh command` to get a private response
- `/gloss help` to see this message


Please note that we're all encouraged to set definitions for words or phrases if they're not yet defined by using the `/gloss term = definition` command.
