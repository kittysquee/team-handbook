# When do we work?

- Most people start work around 09:30 and work an 8 hour day
- There are no strict regulations about when to work, but it's often easier to align most of your working day with the rest of your team, especially if you do work that requires feedback from someone else.
- Respect peoples time off, don't send messages or expect replies after your team mates have signed off for the day 
- Make sure your team knows if you're not working. Using a calendar is a good way to communicate this
- If a team has a regular standup scheduled you are expected to attend or to let the team know in advance that you can't make it that day.
